# Development
> Bitbot is somewhat cobbled together, but is fairly carefully commented and has been factored with ease of change in mind.  

## ‚úîÔ∏è Tests 
[python unit tests](/tests) with the default test framework  
`python3 -m unittest discover tests -v`

## ‚úâÔ∏è Env vars 
`BITBOT_TESTRUN` loads one chart and then exits  
`BITBOT_SHOWIMAGE` [opens the image in vscode](/run.py) after loading the chart  
`BITBOT_OUTPUT` may be set to `disk` to write to disk rather than the e-ink display  
`export BITBOT_TESTRUN=true BITBOT_OUTPUT=disk BITBOT_SHOWIMAGE=true`

## üìª Easy WiFi config 
[`comitup`](https://github.com/davesteele/comitup) is used for the ***disk image***, it creates a **config hotspot** on the Pi if it **cant connect** to any wifi itself.  
The config file is located at `/etc/comitup.conf`
```sh
# show comitup info
sudo comitup -i
# open cli (easy to delete connections here)
sudo comitup-cli
```

## üå≥Logging 
BitBot will log to the `config web-ui` `syslog`, `StdOut` and a rolling `logs/debug.log` file, configured in [üìÅlogging.ini](/logging.ini)  
Log level is **defaulted to `INFO`**, but there is some ***limited debug level logging*** if you wish to get more info.  
Cron jobs were configured to output to syslog. üòû
```sh
# roling file log
tail ~/bitbot/debug.log
# follow syslog
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep 'Bitbot:'
```

## üéÅ Packages

 - [Pimoroni](pimoroni.com) [`inky`](https://github.com/pimoroni/inky) does the **e-ink display**, 
 - [`CCXT`](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) talks to **crypto exchanges**
 - [`MPL-Finance`](https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-finance) **draws the graphs** (and could do with updating to [`mplfinance`](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance))
 - [`Pillow`](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) draws **drawing overlay** text onto the graph

## üê≥ Docker 
**Github actions** builds and tests and publishes a **container image** on each commit to `main` and `release`  

üê≥ Build on `x86` is way faster than on the Pi.
```sh
# remove the `--platform` args if building on a pi
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm/v6  . -t bitbot -f scripts/docker/dockerfile --progress string
```
üê≥ Run **Priviledged access** is needed for `GPIO`, this looks to be fixable thru bind mounts.
```sh
docker run --privileged --platform linux/arm/v6 bitbot
```
