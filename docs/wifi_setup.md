 - Bitbots raspberry pi has quite a ***small antenna***, and it may be struggling to get a **good signal**. Try moving your Bitbot to a location closer to your home WiFi access-point 
 > ### I dont see the Bitbot WiFi access-point
 - Ensure that your Bitbot is **powered up** and has refreshed its screen to show the ***connection warning message***, there should be a **green light** on the back of the raspberry pi.
 - In case of a software failure, you can ***use a computer*** to [write your wifi details **directly to the SD-Card**](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2017/04/manually-setting-up-pi-wifi-using-wpa_supplicant-conf/).
 > ### My phone/computer does not prompt me to sign-in
 - Your phone may ask you if you **want to stay connected** even though there is ***no internet access***, please stay connected if this happens.
 - Open a browser window and type **bitbot** into the **address bar**, you should now be presented with a list of wifi access points as per **step 3 in the Detailed Guide above**.
